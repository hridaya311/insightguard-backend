# InsightGuard v1 — Sales Script (1 Page)

## Product Promise (one sentence)

InsightGuard is used right before financial results or projections are approved externally to prevent flawed reasoning from being signed off as fact.

## The Moment of Truth (when it is used)

InsightGuard runs at the last mile of financial approval — immediately before:

- CFO / VP Finance sign-off
- Board package finalization
- Investor or lender reporting approval
- Forecast / guidance release
- External projection sharing

It is not a planning tool.
It is a sign-off gate.

## The Core Problem (buyer pain)

Finance leaders are not afraid of bad numbers — they are afraid of:

- internally inconsistent forecasts
- narratives that don’t match the math
- unexplained deltas across periods
- margin logic that doesn’t hold under scrutiny

Most tools check calculation correctness.
Almost none check reasoning correctness.

That gap is where approval risk lives.

## What InsightGuard Does (in plain terms)

InsightGuard verifies that:

- material changes are explicitly explained
- narrative direction matches numeric direction
- margin behavior is structurally consistent
- stated assumptions logically connect to outcomes
- required reasoning inputs are present

It returns only two outcomes:

PASS → No reasoning conflicts that justify blocking approval
FAIL → Reasoning conflicts detected — approval should pause or be explicitly justified

Fail-closed by design.

## “So What If It Fails?” — The Buyer Answer

If you approve anyway after a FAIL, you are accepting known reasoning risk.

Typical real-world consequences:

- board or investor challenge you cannot defend
- audit flags and rework
- forecast credibility loss
- decision errors based on faulty logic
- forced revisions after external distribution

InsightGuard does not replace judgment.
It makes hidden reasoning risk visible before exposure.

## The 3 Demo Failure Stories

### 1 — Unreconciled Deltas
Revenue moves materially, but the narrative never explains why.

Risk prevented: unexplained variance sign-off

### 2 — Narrative ↔ Numeric Misalignment
Narrative claims margin expansion, but margins decline.

Risk prevented: story/math contradiction in board decks

### 3 — Baseline Constraint Violation
Operating margin improves while gross margin is flat/down with no opex lever explained.

Risk prevented: structurally implausible profitability logic

## What InsightGuard Does NOT Claim (trust boundary)

InsightGuard v1 does NOT verify:

- market realism
- competitive dynamics
- macro assumptions
- strategy quality
- demand forecasts

It verifies internal reasoning coherence only.

## Ideal First Buyer

- VP Finance
- Director of FP&A
- CFO (hands-on with forecasts)

At companies that:
- produce recurring forecasts
- present to boards or lenders
- issue external projections
- care about sign-off discipline

## Value Framing

InsightGuard is priced against:

- one avoided forecast credibility failure
- one prevented board challenge incident
- one avoided retraction cycle
- one avoided audit escalation

It is a risk control layer, not an analytics tool.

## Close Line

“If this flags a FAIL right before your board pack goes out — and saves you from defending broken logic — would that be worth having in your sign-off flow?”
